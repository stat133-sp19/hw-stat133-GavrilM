# Workout 1: GSW Shot Charts

## About  

This homework assignment is about managing file structure, performing data transformations and visualizations with R, and doing analysis on the data. Then, we create a report presenting what insights have been gained from the data and takeaways from our data exploration.  
  
More specifically, we analyse the shot performance of 5 players on the Golden State Warriors NBA team, and display shot efficiency and shot chart visualizations of the data.

## Usage 

Use Rstudio and open as a project with the `workout1.Rproj` file. This ensures file paths are preserved with the correct working directory and objects can be loaded correctly.
